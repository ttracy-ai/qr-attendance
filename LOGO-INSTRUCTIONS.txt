LOGO SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
=======================

To add your EdTech logo to the attendance app:

1. Save your logo image as "logo.png" in this folder
   (The same folder as index.html)

2. Supported formats:
   - logo.png (recommended)
   - logo.jpg
   - logo.svg

3. Recommended logo size:
   - Height: 70-100px
   - Transparent background works best

4. If using a different filename, edit index.html line 13:
   Change: <img src="logo.png" ...>
   To:     <img src="your-filename.png" ...>

The logo will appear in the top-left corner of the header
with your EdTech branding text next to it.
